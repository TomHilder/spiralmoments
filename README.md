# spiralmoments

Companion code repository for [Calcino et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929L..25C/abstract).

Please Note: this code is currently in the process of being improved and ported into a sub-module of [`wakeflow`](https://github.com/TomHilder/wakeflow) for more general use. If you are interested in using `spiralmoments` to project spiral shapes to emission layers or to create semi-analytic predictions of peak velocity maps, please head over there. Please also do not hesistate to contact me at thomas.hilder@monash.edu

We used this code to rotate and project predictions of spiral planet wake shapes onto peak velocity maps of HD 163296 taken in 12CO from the [MAPS program](https://alma-maps.info/), as well as synthetic maps produced with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code [`phantom`](https://github.com/danieljprice/phantom) and radiation transfer code [`mcfost`](https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost). We also used it in companion with [`wakeflow`](https://github.com/TomHilder/wakeflow) to create semi-analytic predictions of the effect of the planet wake in the peak velocity map.
